# Emenemdash Extension For Quarto

Having arguments about what kind of dash to use? This extension solves it. Replaces every dash you can think of with either a minus sign, em-dash or en-dash. And occasionally a non-breaking space.

## Installing

```bash
quarto add MikeLydeamore/emenemdash
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

Yeah you've not gotta do anything.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal example: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
